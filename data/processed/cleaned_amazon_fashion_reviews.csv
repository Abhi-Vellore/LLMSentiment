now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.
now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, i would not get them to do 25,000 steps in walt disney world.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.
now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, i would not get them to do 25,000 steps in walt disney world.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.
now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, i would not get them to do 25,000 steps in walt disney world.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,

now ive been a huge sketchers go walk fan for some time and the only reason i tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
these shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. i use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (i go through shoes fast enough that ive recently consolidated).
if you're a go walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, however, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
the material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. my feet do not feel hot in them.

i have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. but if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.","Very comfortable, cute, and long-lasting",1515369600,,

they look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
with the exception of running (for which i use proper mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
if i could, i'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - i have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so i do look for a good under the foot fit. i could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when i did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
however, this is overall an awesome shoe that i will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). the shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. my previous pair of flex supreme tr 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. this is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,
